## Week 1 (12 January)
**Focus:** Second Iteration: stakeholders feedback integration, feature implementation, tool deployment and testing.

---

### Highlights
- The initial Tool was developed and deployed using **Python** and **Streamlit**.
- Access to the tool was shared with the stakeholder for testing and feedback.
- Feedback from the previous stakeholder session was reviewed and incorporated; overall processing time was reduced to approximately **2–3 minutes**.
- The scoring interface was redesigned for improved usability: **sliders** were replaced with **star ratings**.
- A new feature was implemented: **Tags**, which automatically display the dimension(s) with the highest score in the dataset.
- Following the most recent stakeholder meeting, **two role-specific user cases were** identified:
-- **Data Users**
-- **Data Providers**
- Scoring was adjusted accordingly to fit both use cases.

---

**Outcome:**  
- Set a testing session with the stakeholders, to validate the updated tool, focusing on usability, scoring logic, and role-specific cases.
- Collect, document and prioritise stakeholders' feedback for the next iteration.
- Implement a data storage mechanism (read/write file) to record user responses (to do futher analyses).
